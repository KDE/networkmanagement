    <property name="HwAddress" type="s" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        Hardware address of the device.

    </property>

    <property name="CenterFrequency" type="u" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        Center frequency (in KHz) of the radio channel the device is using to
        communicate with the network when connected.  Has no meaning when the
        device is not connected.
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="Rssi" type="i" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        RSSI of the current radio link in dBm.  This value indicates how strong
        the raw received RF signal from the base station is, but does not
        indicate the overall quality of the radio link.  Has no meaning when the
        device is not connected.
      </tp:docstring>

    <property name="Cinr" type="i" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        CINR (Carrier to Interference + Noise Ratio) of the current radio link
        in dB.  CINR is a more accurate measure of radio link quality.  Has no
        meaning when the device is not connected.

    <property name="TxPower" type="i" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        Average power of the last burst transmitted by the device, in units of
        0.5 dBm.  i.e. a TxPower of -11 represents an actual device TX power of
        -5.5 dBm.  Has no meaning when the device is not connected.

    <property name="Bsid" type="s" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
