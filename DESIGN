DESIGN

Split system

i) KCModule performs connection configuration

ii) Settings service exists on the system bus and provides information to NetworkManager

iii) Plasmoid gives user feedback i
      Notifications
      Status in popup
    and connection control
      Calls DBUS methods on manager, passing references to objects supplied by the setings service
    launches KCModule on request


Directory structure of project

PLASMOID
Functions
* Show current merged connection status
* Show any in-progress operations
* List currently appropriate connections
* Allow activation of appropriate connections
* Show status of current connections
* Allow disconnect of active connections
* Allow user to select flight mode
* Allow user to select offline mode
* Allow user to launch KCM
* Show extended connection information
* Perform notifications
 
KCM
Functions
* Show currently configured connections
** show name, type, date of last use
* Allow import of system connections
* Add new connection
** Save connection data to kconfig and kwallet
* Edit existing connection
** Read connection data from kconfig and kwallet
* Delete existing connection
* Secrets may not be stored at all for extreme security, provide kioskable setting for this
* Show warning label if NM is not running.

Implementation:
* List connections by type in main KCM DONE
  * Store connectionId using KTreeWidgetItem::setData() DONE
* There is only one KCM plugin; the other widgets are KCMs (to take advantage of KCModule's good KConfigSkeleton integration) but are not loaded as plugins DONE
* Pass connectionId to connection specific KCM for new or edited connections DONE
* Connect up non-trivial UI to save settings (esp wireless security, 802.1x and ppp)
* Connect up wireless security type combo to tabWidget
* Delete connections deletes config file DONE
  * and wallet entries

Connection types (as used in nm-applet)
wired: connection wired 8021x ipv4
wireless: connection wireless wirelesssecurity ipv4
mobilebb:
  cdma: cdma ppp
  gsm: gsm ppp
vpn: connection ipv4
dsl: connection dsl wired ppp

Characteristics
* Use storage layer shared with service.

SERVICE
Functions
* Provide service on system dbus containing configured connections
* Update configured connections following configuration changes
* Emit NewConnection on dbus as needed
* Provide dbus settings objects that provide org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerSettings.Connection and org.freedesktop.NetworkManagerSettings.Connection.Secrets
* Request secrets if required
* Persist changed secrets to kwallet

Characteristics
* Lives in kded
* Watches config file for changes or has simple dbus api with configure() method like kscreensaver
* Uses storage layer shared with KCM
** Added connections
** Updated connections (how? dbus signal? sequence number in config file?)
** Removed connections (compare list of configured connections with active connections)

Implementation
* kded module
* readConfiguration (KConfigToService::init())
** Read central knetworkmanagerrc for connection IDs - DONE
** Read connections from apps/knetworkmanager/connections - DONE
** Read config schemas from apps knetworkmanager/configschema - DONE 
** per-setting group helper class for complex settings, where needed. DONE for ipv4 config read
*** How to figure out whether these are needed at runtime? put in shlib to use with kcm, but separate from UI.
*** ipv4 (really only ipv4 afaics)
* configure method accessible over dbus DONE
** calls rereadConfiguration (KConfigToService::update()) DONE
* GetSecrets. will be received by Connection. emit signal received by NetworkSettings, relayed up ( NetworkSettings knows nothing of storage).  Catch in KConfigToService and ask each configxml for that setting's groups to get secrets?

STORAGE LAYER
Functions

Characteristics
Serializer converts between kconfig storage and qvariantmapmaps
and between kconfig storage and UI contents (like kconfigdialog).
and kwallet

Uses a .kcfg file to define settings.  Since .kcfg allows multiple groups should be able to define all in one .kcfg file.

Use nested groups in rcfile.

Load kcfg, create in memory representation?  Or just work from XML tree?

Flag passed to ConfigXml controls whether it should load secrets or skip this (for the dbus service, which should not open the wallet until queried by the NM daemon)

READ
Open rcfile.
enumerate connections (top level value).
For each connection:
  get ID
  enumerate settings:
  For each setting:
    pass setting to handler
    enumerate values:
	For each value:
	  lookup name(entry) for setting(group) in kcfg
	  lookup value of entry
	  lookup type for entry
	  lookup min, max if present (or if numeric type)
      pass these to appropriate handler for type
      if a secret=true entry, create an Item that reads KWallet instead of KConfig

handler settings:
  map handler: create new qvariantmap, insert it using setting name, set this on the map handler as current map.
  ui handler: locate child widget called "$name_setting_widget", set it on the ui handler as current widget
handler values:
  map handler: insert qvariant into setting's map with name
  ui handler: locate child widget named "$name_item_widget" and set value, min, max using methods appropriate to widget type 

The UI case is nearly the same as what KConfigXT already does, the difference is that it operates on a top level group only instead of the whole file. Could we use KConfigDialogManager with a custom KConfigSkeleton?

Assessed KConfigSkeleton.  Can we point it at an arbitrary KConfigGroup?  Can we set it up with custom Items read from the kcfg.  Will it read/write those correctly?  

** Yes, all of this is already done, using ConfigXml from Plasma.  Our copy adds support for KWallet and storing byte arrays

I thought that KConfigDialog only allows a single managed widget but KConfigDialog can handle an arbitrary number of widgets and their children.  Still might have to use the Manager directly to work on a widget in a KCM.

WRITE
From ui:
KCModule::writeConfig();
// todo, document how custom settings are saved
