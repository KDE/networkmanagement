==============
* = not done, will be either done by WS, or should be at least discussed first with WS
+ = not done, I don't plan on doing it that soon
    - in other words, these should be the best ones for you if you want to help
! = like +, but they should be relatively simple
    - in other words, these should be the best if you want to get started with the code
/ = work in progress
? = should it be done?
% = should be probably done later, during cleanups and preparations for being stable
. = done, remove when DESIGN is updated


TODO CB:
- Create a network scanning view - In Progress
    - Create Scrolling View
    - Scan Actual APs
- Create a profile class which describes network settings
- Create a profile creation view/wizard
- Create a profile editing view

TODO WS:
- SERVICE: Complete settings service
  * per-setting group helper class for complex settings, where needed for ipv4 config write
  * wireless security
    / WEP
    / WPA-PSK
    * LEAP
    * WPA-EAP
  + also for 802.1x
  . Create Connection.Secrets objects and do lazy secret loading. Change configxml classes to not read wallet on start
    * Show connection UI to get secrets on demand if the wallet does not contain them or if the
      daemon requested new secrets
  ! write LastUsed to knetworkmanagerrc on successful connection activation


- CONFIG: Implement control module
  + Write a nice class to turn a QDateTime into "3 minutes ago", "5 hours ago" instead of using KLocale::formatDate(), or extend KLocale with formatDateRelative(QDateTime in, QDateTime relativeTo)
  . Add UI for selecting cellular connection type,
    * detect and disable for existing connections
  ! Replace Ok button with Close in main connectioneditor, or implement storage of changed/added connection settings in temp files until the Ok button is clicked, and enable deleting temp files if Cancel is clicked
  ! Edit on double click existing entry
  / Complete most settings widgets' complex (non-KConfigSkeleton-managed) UI plumbing and reimplemented save routines
  + Option to display system-provided connections and import them so they can be edited (probably depends on PolicyKit)
  . Show the ScanWidget from widgets developed by CB

- APPLET: Make sure system tray+engine does what we need
  * Popup menu
    / Connection List
       / Two possible connection list display styles
         / List connections appropriate to currently active hardware
           / Update based on hardware and AP changes
           + Extend to profiles
         + a list of all currently seen APs (like trad applet)
       / Group connections by device (or by device type if connection could be activated on >1 device)
         / Item contents
           . Name
           . Type
           / Extended information (System/user connection; IP config; pppStats bytes up/down stats (FEATURE) etc)
           . Activate button
         / Wireless connection item
           . Signal strength
         * Cellular connection item
           * Signal strength
           * UMTS/GPRS
           * Network name
         / VPN connections - group without interface.  Can be activated on single active connection
           or on the connection owning the default route.  Drag and drop to activate on another
           connection
         * Remove connections that are active from the connection list, they are shown on the
           InterfaceItem
         * Wireless interface groups should maintain a merged WirelessEnvironment for all interfaces' environments,
           for maintaining its appropriate connection list.
        / Disconnect button
    . Connection editor
    / Flight mode toggle
    * Disconnected toggle
    * Hardware wifi switch indicator
    + Adhoc network button
  * Tooltips
  / Show network status in tray icon
    % Option to have one icon per device, (like in Windows, hschaa's request)
    / Show network interface's status that is most important to the
      user when showing single icon
    + Animation during connection state

   
- Update Solid
  % Implement ModemManager (after NM 0.7.0 is released) and new VPNManager, if appropriate, in Solid, else in applet
