Since the release of the new Plasma NM applet (version 0.9.3) this repository
is mostly deprecated. Only NM/0.9 branch has any use (for now). That branch
holds the old stable Plasma NM 0.9.0.x version.

Unless you have a patch to fix one of bugs in the old Plasma NM 0.9.0.x [1] you
should use plasma-nm repository instead of this one. There is even a frameworks
branch in plasma-nm, so it already works with frameworks5, which
networkmanagement does not.
